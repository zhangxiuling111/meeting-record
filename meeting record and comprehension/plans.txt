Next meeting (14 Jun 2018)

- Report the analysis on the code for the paper "Model Checking Paxos in Spin", focusing on how liveness fails in the PROMELA model.

- Discuss two new papers:
  * Fast Paxos (Lamport 2005)
  * In Search of an Understandable Consensus Algorithm (Ongaro and Ousterhout 2014)
  
- Possible directions:
  * Modelling stronger assumptions that ensure progress properties for Paxos like algorithms
  * A purely nondeterministic model for Raft/Zab (also lists sources of livelock/nonprogress)
  
- Other thoughts
  * probabilistic model on Paxos/Raft/Zab, by using e.g., in PRISM (http://www.prismmodelchecker.org)
  * Byzantine models (with adversaries nodes)
  * Compare the efficiencies between leader election model and Blockchain models (PoW, PoS)
